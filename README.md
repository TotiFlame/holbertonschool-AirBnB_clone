# AirBnB Console
This project is about to create a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This is the first step to build our AirBnB clone.
## Console
**What is a command interpreter?**
	It's a program where the user can type commands to manage the objects of the project.
In the console, we can, for example:
 - Create a new object (ex: new User or a new Place)
 - Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
 - Do operation on objects (count, compute stats, etc)
 - Update attributes of an object
 - Destroy an object

## Install
To install in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/gallit0/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone

To execute:

    ./console.py
